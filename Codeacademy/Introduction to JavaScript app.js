/*Letâ€™s take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and *//*.
There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.*/
