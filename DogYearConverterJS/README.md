# Dog Years

Welcome to the Dog Years project! This simple JavaScript application converts human years into "dog years", helping you understand how old you would be if you were a dog. Given that dogs age faster than humans, this conversion provides a fun perspective on age and growth.

## Concept

- The first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each.
- Each subsequent year counts as 4 dog years.

This calculation gives you a glimpse into the accelerated pace of aging in dogs compared to humans.

## Usage
