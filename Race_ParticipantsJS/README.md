# 🏁 Welcome to the Grand JavaScript Race! 🏁

Hello, swift developers and racing enthusiasts! Are you ready to lace up your running shoes and join the virtual race of a lifetime? Let's get your race number and find out your start time with a sprinkle of JavaScript magic!

## 🏃‍♂️ The Starting Line

Before the race begins, every runner must receive a number. Whether you're an early bird or a last-minute arrival, our script ensures you get your place in the race. And worry not, age is but a number here, except when it decides your start time!

## 🎽 How to Get Your Race Number

1. Register early or late—fate decides your gate.
2. Let the script know your age, no wisdom here—just numbers on a page.
3. Run the script and watch the console for your fate.
4. Your race number and start time will magically appear, don't be late!
