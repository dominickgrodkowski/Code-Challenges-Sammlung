# USD Calculation PHP

## Project Description

We’re exhausted having just returned to New York City from a whirlwind of world travel. We’re bringing all our international currency to the bank to be exchanged for USD. Our travels have made us wise and weary, and we want to ensure we’re being treated fairly. Can you help?

This program calculates exactly how much cash in USD we should end up with after it has all been exchanged.

## Travel Summary

- We had a blissful time at Lake Yeak Laom in Ratanakiri, Cambodia and ended up with 2,103,942 riel left in our pocket.
- We saw the best sunset of our lives in Hpa-an, Myanmar and left the country with 19,092 kyat.
- We got our fill of fjords in Bergen, Norway and discovered 109 krones that went unspent.
- We soaked up the sun and history in Saranda, Albania and found 9,094 lek scattered throughout our luggage when we arrived home to NYC.
